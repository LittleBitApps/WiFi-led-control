# WiFi-led-control

* This repository contains the source code for the android app WiFi LED control. The app can be downloaded [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.bit.little.wifiledcontrol) on the Google Play Store.
* A template FLASK server (Python) is included in this repositroy and can be implemented for various LED projects with developer boards such as a Raspberry Pi.  
* The application sends simple POST requests with the color in hex-format (e.g. {"color": "ff00ff"}) to an URL/IP-address.
* The color wheel has been implemented by using Lars Werkman's Holo Colorpicker which can be found [here](https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker).
